# Face-Detection
Recognizes the faces based on a dataset provided, the more the number of faces the more accurate it is

face.Train.py needs to be executed before running faceRecognition.py as it trains the model.
features.npy, labels.npy and face_trained.yml are created by faceTrain.py and are called in faceRecognition.py

The Faces folder contains the faces that were used to train the model, they can be changed.

face.jpeg is the picture of the face to be recognized. It can be changed as long as the name of the file and the extension remainds the same.
